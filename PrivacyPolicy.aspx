                Welcome to SoNET, an online service operated by SM NetServ Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
                which consists of an application created by SM NetServ Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and
                available through social networking sites (“SoNET App”). Please read this Privacy
                Policy to understand how we use any information we may collect from you through
                our SoNET App. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it
                from time to time. Each time you use the SoNET App or provide us with information,
                you are, by doing so, accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at
                that time. If we materially change our practices with regard to personal information
                collected under a prior privacy policy, we will endeavor to notify you and give
                you the opportunity to opt out of changes with regard to that previously collected
                information. You agree that by using the SoNET App you are expressly and affirmatively
                consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and consenting

                necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law
                enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of SM NetServ or other users of
                the SoNET App. In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed
                on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy

                or without notice. Controlling Your Personal Information Be advised that if you
                send messages or post material containing personal information, that information
